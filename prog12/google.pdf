0 -2.2 TD

T*
(Obviously, Google doesnít do the search by going out on the Internet when you make a)Tj
0 -1.1 TD
(search request.  Instead, they gather up information on web pages ahead of time and)Tj
T*
(store this information on their own servers.  They have to store it in a way that)Tj
T*
(facilitates rapid search.  This is often called *indexing*.  We now know enough)Tj
T*
(techniques to have a shot at explaining how Google manages to organize their)Tj
T*
(information in a way that allows searches in a fraction of a second.  Since we donít)Tj
T*
(really know how Google does it, we will talk about a new search company called Binge)Tj
T*
(\(Binge Is Not Google Either\) and discuss how they might do it.)Tj
0 -2.2 TD
(To start with, *indexing* is not mysterious at all.  Every time Binge sees a new web)Tj
0 -1.1 TD
(page, it creates a *file* on its hard disk\(s\) to store information about the page,)Tj
T*
(such as its URL, date it was seen, and perhaps even a compressed copy.)Tj
0 -2.2 TD
(Inside the computer, you address individual *bytes*.  On a hard disk, the smallest)Tj
0 -1.1 TD
(unit that can be addressed is a *block*, usually 512 \(2^9\) bytes.  A file and the web)Tj
T*
(page it represents can be indexed by the address of its first block.  However, disks)Tj
T*
(are only terabytes in size.  A 8T \(2^43 byte\) disk has 16 billion \(2^34\) blocks)Tj
T*
(\(34+9=43\).  But there are trillions of web pages out there.  So Binge is going to need)Tj
T*
(at least 100 hard disks, probably many more.  Still, thatís pretty reasonable for a)Tj
T*
(company.)Tj
0 -2.2 TD
(The index includes the disk number followed by the block number on that disk.  Six)Tj
0 -1.1 TD
(bytes is probably plenty.  The first 12 bytes indicate the disk number and the)Tj
T*
(remaining 34 are the block number on the 8T disk.  In any case, an int is not enough)Tj
T*
(since it is only four bytes.  An 8-byte long is way more than enough.  \(Of course, when)Tj
T*
(we switched from 16-bit integers to 32-bit integers, we thought *those* were way more)Tj
T*
(than enough.\))Tj
0 -2.2 TD
(So the index of a web page is a unique long \(64-bit\) integer.  Since it corresponds to)Tj
0 -1.1 TD
(a disk and a block on a disk, we can get to the web page information file in one disk)Tj
T*

T*
(Suppose we see a link, http://www.cs.miami.edu/òvjm/csc220/index.html.  Do we need to)Tj
0 -1.1 TD
(index it?  Or is it indexed already?  How can Binge know?)Tj

(I have already explained that the COMPRESSED TRIE you implemented would make a good)Tj
0 -1.1 TD

T*
